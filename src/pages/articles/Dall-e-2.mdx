## Short tour through DALL-E 2.

I have now had access to DALL-E 2 for almost two weeks and have been able to test the artificial intelligence extensively.

IMO, DALL-E 2 is currently the best available AI system for image generation and editing.

With DALL-E 2 you can create photos, illustrations, paintings, logos, or 3D art with a simple text input.

The quality of the images often approaches or is even comparable to that of professionals.

Alternatives like Midjourney are on the rise, but they don’t yet reach the quality of DALL-E 2.

DALL-E 2’s user interface is as simple as can be: You can enter your text command, called “prompt”,

via an input field and send it to the AI system by clicking “Generate”. After a short waiting time, DALL-E 2 outputs four images.

## Prompt example:

<Image src={designTable1} alt="a design table with cactus on it." />

<Image src={designTable2} alt="3d render of a pastel design table with cactus on it, whitesmoke background." />

<Image src={designTable3} alt="A sunlit indoor area with 3d render of a pastel design table with cactus on it  with pool clear water with translucent water next to a big window, whitesmoke background." />

as you can see, the more you describe your image, the best is the result. The 1st image is random, the 2nd is more specific and the last one is highly detailed.

‘Prompt engineering’ is the art of describing an output in such a way that DALL·E delivers the result you want.

Because the magic text box is the main way of controlling DALL·E, the terms we use to describe each request (or ‘engineer a prompt’) are paramount.

First, as a beginner, knowledge is power, you can also find prompt marketplace & database on web ( links below ).
