Stripe is a third-party payment solution built for many eCommerce platforms to take the work out of billing.

## Pricing and Transaction fees with Shopify,

there are two overarching pricing components to take into account.

Of course, to use Shopify Payment, you have to use the Shopify platform and pay their monthly fee.

Shopify’s subscription fees depend on the Shopify plan you choose. Currently, they offer you these plans:

1.  Shopify Lite: $9/mth
2.  Basic Shopify: $29/mth
3.  Shopify: $79/mth
4.  Advanced Shopify: $299/mth
5.  Shopify Plus: $????/mth

Other than the monthly subscription fee, you will also have to pay credit card processing fees.

Shopify Payment does not charge setup, cancellation, PCI compliance, or other similar extraneous fees.

And when you use Shopify Payments as your payment solution, the transaction rate will differ based on your plan.

1. Shopify Lite: for online payments 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction, for in-person payments 2.7% per transaction
2. Basic Shopify: for online payments 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction, for in-person payments 2.7% per transaction
3. Shopify: for online payments 2.6% + $0.30 per transaction, for in-person payments 2.5% per transaction
4. Advanced Shopify: for online payments 2.4% + $0.30 per transaction, for in-person payments 2.4% per transaction
5. Shopify Plus: Based on your pricing customized plan

Plus, Shopify also charges a 1% additional fee for international cards.

So as you can see, the higher subscription plans you choose, the lower rate you receive credit card processing.

## Pricing and Transaction fees for Stripe,

there isn’t any monthly or annual fee to sign up for an account and use their payments platform on an ongoing basis.

Like Shopify Payment, Stripe also does not charge for setup, account cancellation, PCI compliance, or any other similar hidden fees.

But it is important to note that Stripe will charge a $15 fee for chargebacks.

Overall, with Stripe, the only fee you have to pay is the transaction fee.

Stripe charges you the transaction fees with different rates depends on the customer’s payment method:

1. Online credit or debit card: 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction; additional 1% fee if it’s an international card payments, plus another 1% if require currency conversion
2. ACH direct debit: 0.8% per transaction, the maximum fee is $5
3. ACH credit: $1 per payment
4. Local payment methods: Starting at 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction, may vary based on payment methods
5. Online invoicing: 0.5% per recurring transaction after your first $1 million in recurring payments
6. In-person credit and debit card: 2.7% + $0.05 per transaction, also additional 1% fee if it’s an international card payments
7. Stripe will charge a 1% additional fee for international cards.

So generally, Stripe is affordable and offers pricing that is both transparent and easy to understand.

But remember, a critical note is that if you use a third-party provider like Stripe, Shopify will charge you an additional fee to pay for that provider.

So, long story short, Shopify makes it easier and more affordable for you to use Shopify Payments as your payment processing instead of another third-party solution.

## Conclusion

Bottom line, because of the inherent differences between Shopify Payment vs Stripe, it is difficult to compare them directly.

Overall, Shopify Payments and Stripe are on par in terms of features and usability.

So keep in mind that the right choice for your business depends on how you are selling online.

In short, Stripe works best for business owners looking for a more customizable and flexible payments solution and have not necessarily built a store on Shopify.

But if you currently or plan to use Shopify as your eCommerce platform, then Shopify payment will be a much better choice. Because if you use Stripe instead of Shopify, you will cough up an extra fee of 1% to 2% per transaction.
